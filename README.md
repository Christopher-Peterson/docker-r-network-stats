# R Network Statistics discussion group

This is the git repository for a group that will be discussing Kolaczyk and Cs√°rdi's *Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R*.

A docker file (along with installation instructions) with RStudio and relevant dependencies can be found in the `docker` subdirectory.

If you're in the group, please contact me and I'll add you as a collaborator.  

Beyond sharing code, we may be able to use other GitHub features to help with this class.  For example, the issues could be a good place for some more specific discussions that would clog up the email chain.
