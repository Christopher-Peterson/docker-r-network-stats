# R Network Statistics discussion group

This is the git repository for a group that will be discussing olaczyk and Cs√°rdi's *Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R*.

A docker file (along with installation instructions) with RStudio and relevant dependencies can be found in the `docker` subdirectory.

If you're in the group, please contact me and I'll add you as a collaborator.
