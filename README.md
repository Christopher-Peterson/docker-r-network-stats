# R Network Statistics discussion group

This is the git repository for a group that will be discussing Kolaczyk and Cs√°rdi's *Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R*.
If you're in the group, please contact me and I'll add you as a collaborator.  

To simplify software installation, I've created a docker image (along with installation instructions) that contains RStudio and all the necessary pacakges with their dependencies.
Installation in structions are in the [docker subdirectory](https://github.com/Christopher-Peterson/r-network-stats/tree/main/docker).


Beyond sharing code, we may be able to use other GitHub features to help with this class.  For example, the issues could be a good place for some more specific discussions that would clog up the email chain.
